# Byron Batteson's Blog

My personal blog. Mostly about software development and related fields.

This blog is generated using [Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll), the static site generator.

## Running the site

Just a reminder to myself to run with live reload and draft mode on:

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload --drafts
```
